# Canonical Cuneiform Texts

*Currently __experimental__ and __incomplete__!*

This is a collection of cuneiform tablets in
[Canonical Text Services](http://cite-architecture.org/) format,
from the database of the
[Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative](https://cdli.ucla.edu).
This format is used by a number of viewing an analysis tools
for learning and scholarship. It is hoped that this collection
will make the texts more accessible.
