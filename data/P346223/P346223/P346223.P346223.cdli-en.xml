        <l n="1">At that time(!) the storm was placed together with the city, the city was ruin heaps</l>
        <l n="2">Father Nanna, the city has been placed into ruins, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="3">The storm deprived the land of ..., and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="4">The land was devastated (until) there was not even a broken sherd (left), and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="5">A breach was made in the wall, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="6">At the great gate where there was a path, it was piling up corpses</l>
        <l n="7">In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival, head(s) were placed as seeds</l>
        <l n="8">In the streets, where there were paths, it was piling up corpses</l>
        <l n="9">In the playground, where there was a festival, it spread out people (as) sheaves</l>
        <l n="10">Ditches/burial pits were put down (for) the blood of land like (it would be done for?) the drainpipe of heaven(?)</l>
        <l n="11">(That of) the corpses, (like) sheep fat in sunlight, dissolved by themselves</l>
        <l n="12">Like a man ended by a hazin axe, one was not (bothering to) “clothe his head&quot;/wearing a turban (as a bandage?)</l>
        <l n="13">Like a goat buck caught by a snare, (one) lodged his mouth in the dirt</l>
        <l n="14">And therefore(?) like a man ended by the mitum weapon, one did not (bother to) wear bandages</l>
        <l n="15">As if lying in the birthing place of their mother, one laid in his(!) blood</l>
        <l n="16">Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down (lit. on the shoulder) (as if drunk)</l>
        <l n="17">Those who served with weaponry(?) were slaughtered by weaponry</l>
        <l n="18">The storm took away(?) fugitive men and gazelles (alike?), and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="19">In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger</l>
        <l n="20">The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire</l>
        <l n="21">Water brought away(?) the tiny ones ... the lap of the mother like(!) fish</l>
        <l n="22">The strong grasp of the wetnurse, (this) grasp was loosened</l>
        <l n="23">The allegiance/sense of the land was forgotten, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="24">The treasury of the land was forgotten, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="25">The mother left her city(!?) for (to the detriment of?) her son, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="26">The father turned away from his son, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="27">In the city the spouse was abandoned, the child was abandoned, possessions were scattered</l>
        <l n="28">The blackheaded people went into ...'s solemn place</l>
        <l n="29">The lady left her city like a frightened bird</l>
        <l n="30">Ningal left her city like a frightened bird</l>
        <l n="31">And therefore(?) the possessions ... amassed(?) (there) were annihilated</l>
        <l n="32">In the treasury(?) (which) had possessed ... plundered itself(?)</l>
        <l n="33">(Even) in the ponds, Gibil, the purifier, was performing(?) work</l>
        <l n="34">The high mountain range which no hand approaches, oh lord(?) of the Ekišnugal temple</l>
        <l n="35">The true temple, the great hazin axes were consuming as if in a pack</l>
        <l n="36">(The troops of) Šimašgi and Elam, the destructive ones, were treating it as if it was worth thirty shekels(!?)</l>
        <l n="37">When(?) the pickaxes struck the true temple and city, the people wailed</l>
        <l n="38">They were making the city into ruin heaps, and the people wailed</l>
        <l n="1">Its lady was crying “Alas, my city,” she was crying “Alas, my temple”</l>
        <l n="2">Ningal was crying “Alas, my city,” she was crying “Alas, my temple”</l>
        <l n="3">The woman, the storm destroyed (her) city, the storm destroyed her temple</l>
        <l n="4">Nanna(?), shrine Urim is destroyed, and the people are scattering</l>
        <l n="5">It is the 6th kirugu</l>
        <l n="6">In her cattlepen, in her sheepfold, the woman shouts bitterly, the storm is destoying the city</l>
        <l n="7">It is its gešgigal “response”</l>
        <l n="8">Mother Ningal stands apart from her city like an enemy</l>
        <l n="9">The woman cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed city</l>
        <l n="10">Ningal cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed temple</l>
        <l n="11">An must curse (my) city, my city must be destroyed</l>
        <l n="12">Enlil must curse my temple, the pickaxe must strike(!)</l>
        <l n="13">He (must) cast fire upon my ... coming from the lowland, my city must be destroyed</l>
        <l n="14">Enlil must touch down lightning flame upon his(!?) highland</l>
        <l n="15">At the outskirts of the city, the outer city must be destroyed, and I shall say “Alas, my city”</l>
        <l n="16">In the middle of the city, the inner city must be destroyed, and I shall say “Alas, my city”</l>
        <l n="17">My temple (in) the outskirts of the city is being destroyed, and I shall say “Alas, my city”</l>
        <l n="18">My temple (in) the middle of the city is being destroyed, and I shall say “Alas, my city”</l>
        <l n="19">Therefore, the city is not pastured for me like a fertile ewe, its true shepherd is not present</l>
        <l n="20">Therefore, Urim is not pastured for me like a fertile she-goat, its herder is not present</l>
        <l n="21">My ox does not stand in the cattlepen, its herder is not present</l>
        <l n="22">My sheep do not dwell in their sheepfold, their herder is not present</l>
        <l n="23">The canal of the city thickens with silt and produces(?) fox dens(?)</l>
        <l n="24">In its course it does not bring flowing water, its canal inspector is not present</l>
        <l n="25">In the fields of my city, grain is not present, its farmer is not present</l>
        <l n="26">(In?) my field, like a field that the pickax has struck (to destroy it and render it unusable!?), (only) the “star of the field(?)” plant grows</l>
        <l n="27">In the irrigated orchards that heap up(?) syrup and wine, the thornbush of the mountain grows grows</l>
        <l n="28">In the steppe whose “joy” was surpassing/filled it(?), (it was) emitting (a baking scent?) like an oven(?)</l>
        <l n="29">My possessions are taken away flying like a flock of crows taking flight, I must cry “My possessions!”</l>
        <l n="30">My possessions coming from the lowland are brought back to the lowland, I must cry “My possessions!”</l>
        <l n="31">My possessions coming from the highland are brought back to the highland, I must cry “My possessions!”</l>
